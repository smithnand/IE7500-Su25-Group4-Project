AI for Symptom and Diagnosis Summary 
IE7500: Engineering Natural Language Processing Applied
Group 4
---

### Project Overview
The project develops a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to analyze unstructured patient symptom stories and generate concise summaries in standardized medical terminology. The system benefits healthcare providers by suggesting diagnoses and categorizing cases by urgency level and department, thereby improving efficiency and clinical workflow.

### Problem Statement
Clinicians are often presented with long, unstructured symptom descriptions that are time-consuming to interpret. Our NLP addresses this by summarizing patient data, prioritizing the most relevant symptoms, and suggesting possible diagnoses in clinical language. This helps to speed up triage, enhance communication, and guide medical decision-makingâ€”without replacing professional judgment. 

### Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Symptom and Diagnosis Summarization
Content: 1,200 samples for 24 diseases with 50 natural language symptom descriptions each

Columns:
Label: Name of the disease
Text: Symptom description
More references are CDC and WHO medical reports for uniformity in terms.

### Major Goals
Summarize unstructured medical text into structured format
Detect symptoms and identify negated words
Provide appropriate diagnoses or outcomes
Support clinicians with a standardized, efficient triage tool

### Anticipated Outcomes
Key information extraction from medical text
Disease classification using NLP techniques
Medical term and negation identification
Creation of an interpretable and scalable diagnosis aid system
